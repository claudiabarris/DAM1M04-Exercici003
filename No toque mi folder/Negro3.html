                The Pixelmator Pro image editing engine is seriously sophisticated and incredibly powerful. It’s designed exclusively to take advantage of the full power of Mac computers, using advanced Mac graphics technologies like Metal and Core Image. Pushing the boundaries of image editing, Pixelmator Pro also includes machine learning-enhanced editing features powered by Core ML. So tools aren’t just blistering fast — they’re whip smart too.
